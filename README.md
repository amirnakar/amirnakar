 ðŸ¦ Microbiology ðŸ”¬Photonics ðŸŽ¯Machine Learning
 
I'm a PhD Student at Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology, in Jena, Germany in [Juergen Popp's group](https://www.leibniz-ipht.de/en/research/departments/spectroscopy-and-imaging/overview.html) where we focus on research and development of innovative optical/photonic methods for point-of-care analysis, diagnostics and therapy for medical, life and environmental sciences. 

I also teach some lab courses at [Friedrich Schiller UniversitÃ¤t Jena](https://www.ipc.uni-jena.de/en) - especially on [Biophotonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophotonics) and [Raman spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_spectroscopy)

# Projects
## ðŸ’Šâž¡ðŸ¦  Project Carbatech - Bacterial Diagnostics
Sinec 2019, I've been studying medical applications of Raman spectroscopy. 
The work is done with a wonderful team, under the supervision of [Prof. Juergen Popp](https://www.ipc.uni-jena.de/en/research+groups/popp+group) and Dr. Petra Roesch

We are trying to use Raman spectroscopy for fast diagnostics of antibiotic resistant bacteria in hospitals. 

In our work, we collect spectra directly from bacterial cells, and use machine learning algorithms (such as SVMs) to learn and predict whether those bacteria will be resistant to drugs.
The idea --> to help doctors be able to prescribe the right drugðŸ’Š, to kill off the infection ðŸ¦  - FAST!

## ðŸ’¦ðŸŒˆâž¡ðŸ§« Fast Detection of Water Contaminations
In a previous work, done in [Volcani Center](https://www.agri.gov.il/en/units/institutes/8.aspx),
I was part of an interdisciplinary team which used fluorescence spectroscopy to detect water contaminations.

In that project, we collected water ðŸ’§ from different source wells and measured a huge spectrum ðŸŒˆ of auto-fluorescent signals. 
Using machine learning, we managed to identify the contaminations at X10 below the minimum required range, both in lab models and in our real collected water.
That project was part of a collaboration with [mekorot](https://www.mekorot-int.com/) and the results were published here:
