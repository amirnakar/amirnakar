# Amir Nakar
###
              
I work for [MeMed](https://www.me-med.com/), a med-tech company developing a diagnostic tool based on [host immune response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response).

We're using the host response to diagnose patients and reduce [antibiotic overuse](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antibiotic-resistance) 🩺💊🦠
In my role as Scientific Affairs Lead I help establish international research collaborations, write papers about MeMed's latest clinical trial results and search for future funding opportunities

I did my PhD  at Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology, in [Juergen Popp's group](https://www.leibniz-ipht.de/en/research/departments/spectroscopy-and-imaging/overview.html), working on research and development of innovative optical/photonic tools for point-of-care microbial diagnostics. 

I used to teach at [Friedrich Schiller Universität Jena](https://www.ipc.uni-jena.de/en) - courses on [Biophotonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophotonics) and [Raman spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_spectroscopy)

# Past Projects
## CARBATECH - Bacterial Diagnostics 💊🔬🦠 
Between 2019-2021, I worked on medical applications of Raman spectroscopy. 
The work was done with a wonderful team, under the supervision of [Prof. Juergen Popp](https://www.ipc.uni-jena.de/en/research+groups/popp+group) and Dr. Petra Roesch

We were trying to use Raman spectroscopy for fast diagnostics of antibiotic resistant bacteria in hospitals. 

In our work, we collected spectra directly from bacterial cells, and used machine learning algorithms (such as SVMs) to predict whether those bacteria are resistant to drugs.
The idea --> to help doctors be able to prescribe the right drug 💊, to kill off the infection 🦠 - FAST!

## Fast Detection of Water Contaminations 💦🌈🧫 
Between 2016-2018 I worked in [Volcani Center](https://www.agri.gov.il/en/units/institutes/8.aspx).
I was part of an interdisciplinary team which used fluorescence spectroscopy to detect water contaminations.

In that project, we collected water 💧 from different source wells and measured a huge spectrum 🌈 of auto-fluorescent signals. 
Using machine learning, we managed to identify the contaminations at X10 below the minimum required range, both in lab models and in our real collected water.
That project was part of a collaboration with [mekorot](https://www.mekorot-int.com/)
