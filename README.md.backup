I'm a PhD Student at Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology, in Jena, Germany. <br />
In [Juergen Popp's group](https://www.leibniz-ipht.de/en/research/departments/spectroscopy-and-imaging/overview.html) we focus on research and development of innovative optical/photonic methods for point-of-care analysis, diagnostics and therapy for medical, life and environmental sciences. 

I also teach at [Friedrich Schiller Universit√§t Jena](https://www.ipc.uni-jena.de/en) - especially on [Biophotonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophotonics) and [Raman spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_spectroscopy)

- [@nakar_a: Anybody knows how to make this kind of plot in #R &lpar;#ggplot2 or #plotly&rpar;, and how to organize data?Each dot is a sample &lpar;patient&rpar;. I really like how it shows the distribution.Maybe... @dror_barak @AArgoetti @Dale_Masch #DatavisualizationOriginal fig:](https://rss.app/articles/cb4e791f6f6d729c074351566bd3a7c508111d6e113eb9e0d0dd8655969266d3f70cea0d6ddfde6cf4a16c78db12069067d26fe5c311)
- [@nakar_a: It&#39;s also interesting from a biological angle - how an organism can just add 30% of another organisms genes and still look and act almost the same?Makes you think.And makes me appreciate my pal Sindy even moreThe full story was published today:  &lpar;7/7&rpar;](https://rss.app/articles/cb4e791f6f6d729c074351566bd3a7c508111d6e113eb9e0d0dd8655969266d3f70cea0d6ddedf6afba06375d712069165dc68e7c212)
- [@nakar_a: What does this mean?It means that somehow, these highly infectious bacteria can trick us into thinking that they&#39;re one thing, while underneath they&#39;re a chimera of two!It means they might look normal but actually be drug resistant - and you&#39;ll find too late &lpar;6/7&rpar; üè•üöëüë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è](https://rss.app/articles/cb4e791f6f6d729c074351566bd3a7c508111d6e113eb9e0d0dd8655969266d3f70cea0d6ddedf6afba06375d91c0e9467d76ce5c013)
- [@nakar_a: And yes, it checked. This MRSA was a hybrid! Somehow it got a large chunk of DNA from another type and attached it to itself.Now, microbiologists might say &quot;oh, happens all the time, plasmids and MGE etc&quot;. This one is special.This was 30% OF THE GENOME!... a real chimera! &lpar;5/7&rpar;](https://rss.app/articles/cb4e791f6f6d729c074351566bd3a7c508111d6e113eb9e0d0dd8655969266d3f70cea0d6ddedf6afba06375db120c9566dc68e5c114)
- [@nakar_a: She found a double match. A type that was actually two types!She re-ran the whole thing again, only to find again the double match.Strange. This never happened before.She then took out all the stops and sequenced the whole thing, with two devices! Just to make sure... &lpar;4/7&rpar;](https://rss.app/articles/cb4e791f6f6d729c074351566bd3a7c508111d6e113eb9e0d0dd8655969266d3f70cea0d6ddedf6afba0637ad611069661d56ce3c71b)

# Projects
## üíä‚û°ü¶† Project Carbatech - Bacterial Diagnostics
Since 2019, I've been studying medical applications of Raman spectroscopy. 
The work is done with a wonderful team, under the supervision of [Prof. Juergen Popp](https://www.ipc.uni-jena.de/en/research+groups/popp+group) and Dr. Petra Roesch

We are trying to use Raman spectroscopy for fast diagnostics of antibiotic resistant bacteria in hospitals. 

In our work, we collect spectra directly from bacterial cells, and use machine learning algorithms (such as SVMs) to learn and predict whether those bacteria will be resistant to drugs.
The idea --> to help doctors be able to prescribe the right drugüíä, to kill off the infection ü¶† - FAST!

## üí¶üåà‚û°üß´ Fast Detection of Water Contaminations
In a previous work, done in [Volcani Center](https://www.agri.gov.il/en/units/institutes/8.aspx),
I was part of an interdisciplinary team which used fluorescence spectroscopy to detect water contaminations.

In that project, we collected water üíß from different source wells and measured a huge spectrum üåà of auto-fluorescent signals. 
Using machine learning, we managed to identify the contaminations at X10 below the minimum required range, both in lab models and in our real collected water.
That project was part of a collaboration with [mekorot](https://www.mekorot-int.com/) and the results were published here:
